There are so many things going on here and there, and we think that doesn't involve us (you) at all.


In this post, I want to convey a few things I'm cautious about when surfing the internet.

### Some Pointers
- Don't believe everything you see, read or hear on the internet
- Often information circulates, and media on the internet always revolve around something wrong and not something victorious (That too is very rare)
- Don't consume information from only one source (fact check!!)
- Don't follow someone or something with 100% (fact check!!)
- Nobody knows what they are doing

With these pointers in mind, let's continue with the post:

### What happens when you don't read at all?

You will not have confidence to talk or articulate about things you care about.

That's the common silent situation everyone feels when hearing a conversation between people you don't understand. You might be someone who wants to have conversations but doesn't understand what people are talking about.

And this is okay. Everyone goes through this.

### What should I read then?

- Books!! Books!! Books!! - Okay, but what types of books do I need to read to get a flow in reading? (Try reading self-help, non-fiction books)
- Read stories about people that impact the world (Autobiography)
- Subjects or topics in Philosophy, Technology, Psychology, Maths, Physics, Biology - anything that piques your interest in reading about

**Here are some of the books that I read (Many books are not listed here)**

*P.S I started reading during my college years - when I was a first year at my college*

### What happens when you read?

- You will have different perspectives of things that revolve around
- Have your own opinions about things that matter
- ability to question everything
- Understanding complex things will be easier - because you have that base of knowledge already

**Fact: Every complex thing is just a combination of different simple things**

### Sounds fun right?

Yeah, yeah now you are thinking that reading is amazing and all - but how do you start? (Good Reads has a yearly challenge so... that's an option, other is picking random books, epub version)

```
Step 1: search keyword + 'book'
Step 2: find catch title books
Step 3: buy one from Amazon/ask a friend
Step 4: read (spend some time)
Step 5: finished? repeat Step 1


```

### Writing is the next step when reading something

An advice I got from a senior faculty was to write everything that you have done in small notes - that you find interesting, complex steps or thoughts written in a notebook (you could use notion to write things)

Many books hold a lot of ideas written between stories, sentences, and quotes that actually might be related to what you are currently doing in life and that info written down will certainly help you in the long term.

That's it for today! See you soon in another post, or Twitter :D
